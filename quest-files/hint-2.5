In the realm of constant change, Proteus drifts through endless forms, and Heraclitus smiles at the flowing of all things.
There, amidst the shifting currents, the swift herald of the gods keeps his records of every passing word.
Yet not all that is written greets the eye; some truths are veiled in shadow, their names beginning with silence.
Follow the traces left by Hermes, for among his hidden messages lies the key to what was sealed.
