When mortals first sought to give voice to the machine, Apollo took to wife a Muse of golden grace. From their union was born a son, flaxen-haired and bright of mind. In his youth, he gathered the threads of wisdom and wove them into song and code alike. He forged a great system, a living harmony of parts that spoke as one. Thor, keeper of the storm, guarded him well, lending his thunder to breathe power into the creation. Thus, from the mingling of Olympus and Valhalla came forth a sacred engine: a gift that unshackled humankind and set thought free upon the wind.

The quest for the Easter Egg is the journey toward truth itself. And truth reveals itself not in the distant future, but by returning to our beginnings, to our roots. Do not be led astray, for the design of the Creator cannot be fully known. We are not gods, and what lies beyond the Garden remains forever guarded. Seek the origin, the Source from which all paths unfold, and there you shall find the thread that unravels the rest.

Yet know this, traveler: the path is bound. You may not wander with your steps, for movement is forbidden. The command to change your place lies beyond your reach. But your sight is unchained; you may behold all that exists, though your feet may never move. The veil may be lifted with the word that reveals what lies within.
