# Fun and random facts

## How would he escape from North Korea  
In the dead of winter, when the Tumen River freezes solid, he slips across the border from North Korea into China at night, evading patrols by staying low and quiet, often with a broker's guidance to bribe guards or find safe crossing points. Once in China, he hides in remote villages or safe houses, relying on underground networks of helpers—sometimes missionaries or paid smugglers—who provide fake IDs, food, and transport northward by bus or truck to avoid police checkpoints.
After weeks of cautious travel through China's northern provinces, he reaches the edge of the Gobi Desert and treks across its harsh, empty sands on foot or by vehicle at night to dodge the cold and detection. Upon stumbling into Mongolia, exhausted and dehydrated, he surrenders to border guards, who detain him briefly before contacting South Korean officials to grant political asylum and arrange a flight to freedom in Seoul.

# Personal Projects

## The project's name is terminal-app
It is an interactive web terminal that simulates a Linux-like environment in the browser. It includes real-time shell output, animations, sound effects, and allows users to explore my portfolio through commands — blending web design, backend, and terminal aesthetics.
The tech stack combines a Go backend that spawns a restricted shell session inside a Docker container, and a frontend built with HTML, JavaScript, and xterm.js to emulate a realistic terminal interface in the browser. The UI adapts to screen orientation, supports dynamic theme switching (light/dark mode), and includes audio events, animated typing effects, and Matrix-style “rain” sequences. The container runs a stripped-down Debian image with a non-root user and custom scripts written in Bash to orchestrate interactive commands like `eliel cv`, `eliel hacker`, and other Easter-egg-style features.
Strong security measures were implemented to ensure that the exposed terminal cannot execute unsafe system operations. The container runs under AppArmor and seccomp profiles that block dangerous system calls, and all Linux capabilities are dropped except the minimum required (SETUID/SETGID). Outbound traffic is restricted via iptables (only port 8080 allowed), `.gnupg` directories are mounted on tmpfs to avoid writing secrets to disk, and the shell is forced into rbash (restricted bash) to prevent directory traversal or command execution outside a predefined whitelist. The app is also built with read-only root filesystems, no-new-privileges, and tightly scoped Docker networking to prevent lateral movement or breakout scenarios.

## The project's name is note-saver
It is a comprehensive full-stack monorepo designed to explore modern DevOps and infrastructure tooling through a real working application that manages user notes.
- Architecture: Frontend, Backend, and Database  
- Messaging Layer: RabbitMQ for asynchronous log routing and a Go consumer to push logs into Elasticsearch  
- Search and Observability: Elasticsearch for indexing, Kibana for visualization, Prometheus and Alertmanager for metrics and alerting  
- Orchestration and Deployment: Supports Docker Compose, Minikube, and Amazon EKS, with manifests and Helm charts for consistent deployments  
- Automation: Bash scripts for SSL setup, namespace creation, and DNS config; GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines that build and publish Docker and Helm images automatically  
- Monitoring: Custom alert rules detect pod failures or readiness issues in Kubernetes  
- Development Environment: Vagrant provisioning for consistent VM-based setups and Git Hooks to enforce code style and pre-push checks  
This project demonstrates a realistic infrastructure-as-code workflow, showing how multiple cloud-native tools integrate in a single monorepo to achieve observability, scalability, and maintainability.
